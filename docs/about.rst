Project Abstract
----------------

It can be challenging for universities to provide applicable, real-world experience to 
undergraduate students. Utilizing development boards provided by Qualcomm, students will 
be able to explore fundamental HDL-based concepts not normally covered in an academic setting. 
Project effectiveness and student engagement is studied for further improvements.

The project is separated into three distinct subsystems: software, infrastructure, and DUT. 
The relationship between each subsystem is outlined according to the block diagrams here and on the 
introductory page. Each subsystem and its complementary documentation is tested for cohesiveness 
according to student participation and subsequent feedback. The subsystems make up a comprehensive 
prototyping environment that will provide valuable FPGA experience for undergraduate students in 
the future and act as a valuable asset for the University of San Diego's computer engineering 
department moving forward.

Project Background
------------------

Our primary goal was to provide an industry-grade development kit to foster advanced digital 
design and hardware platform competencies. This included focusing on building a development kit 
for the given Qualcomm hardware, setting up the infrastructure of the board, instantiating the 
design components, and uitilizing software to directly interface with the board.

The project objectives concentrated on having clear and concise enough information for an undergraduate 
engineering student to utilize and provide illustrations/examples in order to deepen comprehension with
benchmark tests for the completion of each task and providing additional resources for further research.

This capstone project was part of the 2021 University of San Diego Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering 
& Computing Showcase. The landing page can be found `here <https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/resources/capstone-design-projects/showcase-2021.php>`_.
